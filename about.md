### More Information

I love to program and automate things. Things that are mundane and deserves to
be automated.
My goto and favourite programming language is Javascript, although I have been programming
for more then a decade now in various other languages like Java, ABAP, Python , a little
bit of Elixir.

I try to write the things that are usually interesting and new for me in this
blog, so that I can record and share these findings.
