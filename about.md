Full Stack Developer. I love to write both front and backend Javascript for Fun and Work.
I am interested in Elixir and looking for opportunities to work in the same.

Currently , I am in Bangalore and working for various Startups here in
Bangalore.

### More Information

I love to program and automate things. Things that are mundane and deserves to
be automated.
My goto and favourite programming language is Javascript, although I have been programming
for more then a decade now in various other languages like Java, ABAP, Python , a little
bit of Elixir.

I try to write the things that are usually interesting and new for me in this
blog, so that I can record and share these findings.
