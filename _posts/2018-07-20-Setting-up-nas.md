title: How I setup my home NAS Server
---

#### Things Needed ####
* Raspberry Pi 3
* External HDD
* SD Card --> I used a Class 10 32G SD Card.
* A simple mobile charger to power te pi
* A laptop is required to do initial setup
* An external HDMI capabled monitor or TV
* Internet Connection!


#### Raspberry Pi as NAS Server ####

We will be using the cheap and low powered Raspberry PI as our home NAS Server.

We need to download an image of Raspbian which is the debian based OS that will power our pi.

We can install multiple OS in the PI, but since I am setting it up as a headless
server , without the need for any GUI, we will use the [Rasbian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) image.
Download the image into your laptop/desktop(I am using a macbook).
